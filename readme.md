There are currently two popular mods that change the core mechanics of the game, while sticking to the historical backbone: Crusader Kings Plus and Historical Immersion Project (which itself consists of several mods).
This mod is based on both of them and the goal of this mod is to implement the better features of both major mods, while reaching maximum historical accuracy and maintaining an engaging and interesting gameplay. History Plus Realism is based on the CK2+ codebase with cherrypicked changes from HIP and other mods, as well as custom modifications for further realism. It might be considered a metamod, because of how it tries to integrate many other mods together by compliling everything you need in a single module.

HPR has been made by me for my personal use and is unlikely to be actively maintained in the future. It also goes against the rules of Paradoxplaza forums and is therefore not published there. The very notion of having to ask for permission to use mod files in other mods sickens me, this obviously means, that you are free to use any of the changes I've made to the game and it's modifications in your own projects. All credit for the original mods used in HPR goes to their authors.

<b>Current changes, compared to CK2+:</b><br>
-Centralization law system from EMF.<br>
-Negative tax modifier on buildings from EMF and rebalanced tax of buildings, but no levy modifier. The logic behind this is that buildings require maintanence, hence the tax penalty. The levy modifier was not logical and destroyed the balance by giving rulers with many buildings too many levies, de facto creating a regular army way before it started to exist historically.<br>
-Lower bonuses for tech advancements, EMF-like.<br>
-Historical age of marriage: 12 for girls and 14 for boys.<br>
-Dramatically increased number of stillbirths and infant deaths for historical accuracy. Also decreased the average life span of characters by ~10 years, before the change many characters used to live long into their 60s and even 70s, which is ahistorical. Some characters will still survive till that age, but it will be a lot less common. This doesn't mean characters in their 40s will all suddenly start to die for no reason, it just means that the world has become a lot more deadly and staying in good health matters.<br>
-Warscore with an emphasis on battles and sieges of capitals and contested territory.<br>
-ARKO interface.<br>
-Viet traits.<br>
-Viet events.<br>
-Dorimi music pack.<br>
-Various other small tweaks and changes.<br>

<b>TODO:</b><br>
-Rebalance traits and focuses.<br>
-General balance tweaks.<br>
-Moar music.<br>
-Tweaking more numbers for historical accuracy.<br>
-Testing and debugging.<br>
