There are currently two popular mods that change the core mechanics of the game, while sticking to the historical backbone: Crusader Kings Plus and Historical Immersion Project (which itself consists of several mods).
This mod is based on both of them and the goal of this mod is to implement the better features of both major mods, while reaching maximum historical accuracy and maintaining an engaging and interesting gameplay. History Plus Realism is based on the CK2+ codebase with cherrypicked changes from HIP and other mods, as well as custom modifications for further realism. It might be considered a metamod, because of how it tries to integrate many other mods together by compliling everything you need in a single module.

HPR has been made by me for my personal use and is unlikely to be actively maintained in the future. It also goes against the rules of Paradoxplaza forums and is therefore not published there. The very notion of having to ask for permission to use mod files in other mods sickens me, this obviously means, that you are free to use any of the changes I've made to the game and it's modifications in your own projects. All credit for the original mods used in HPR goes to their authors.

-Updated the music to fit SWMH cultures.<br>
-Fixed a bug where a trade route ended in the middle of a desert.<br>
<b>v0.5:</b><br>
-SWMH Map integrated. This is a huge change, probably the largest one since the initial release, and it may cause some issues, especially where events are concerned, even though I'm trying to fix them as best I can, some bugs are bound to go unnoticed. The historical accuracy of the map, however is much higher than that of Vanilla and CK2+, so this change benefits the mod greatly.<br>
At this point the integration of the two big mods mentioned above can be considered complete and HPR has grown from just a tune up of CK2+ to a mod that merges changes from a whole scope of different projects.<br>
-Excommunication has become a much more serious issue. Subjects will now really hate an excommunicated ruler, just like they did historically, they will revolt, refuse to serve and vassals can refuse to provide levies. And there's a piety penalty on top of that.<br>
<b>v0.4.2:</b><br>
-Jus Uxoris mod integrated.<br>
-ARKO Armories mod integrated (sans the flags that were already modified by CK2+).<br>
-Cleaned up some unused junk.<br>
-Minor bugfixes.<br>
<b>v0.4.1:</b><br>
-Trait tweaks and changes.<br>
-Focuses rebalance. Now focuses also have negative effects (results of neglecting areas outside the focus) and include bonuses to various modifiers instead of just stats.<br>
-Increased piety hit for castration and blinding of prisoners to 100 (up from 10).<br>
-Misc. bugfixes.<br>
<b>v0.4:</b><br>
-Major events overhaul. Bonuses of VIET events have been increased drastically (from 5 to 10 times in most cases). Now these events actually matter, not just display some text and because they matter, their frequency of appearance has been decreased (yearly pulse events are now bi yearly, bi yearly are five yearly and five yearly are decade pulse).<br>
-Fixed over 500 event related bugs, according to the Validator.<br>
-Dulcinian heresy added.<br>
<b>v0.3.1:</b><br>
-Updated ARKO interface to 2015-08-20.<br>
-Added missing VIET lifestyle trait related events.<br>
-Started modifying VIET event results to make them matter.<br>
-Added music from "Songs from the four corners" mod (with account for additional CK2+ culture groups).<br>
-Due to the music folder getting too bloated, split off music into a separate mod. Misc. music fixes.<br>
-Some minor bugfixes.<br>
<b>v0.3:</b><br>
-Updated CK2+ base to v3.11.3.<br>
-Blinding can now be done to all prisoners, castration can now be done by all characters to all male prisoners.<br>
-Added fear mechanics, still very raw and requires testing.<br>
-Tweaked birth and child mortality a bit up again, it's really hard to get these numbers right, since there's so little information available on the topic
(http://www.sarahwoodbury.com/life-expectancy-in-the-middle-ages/ is the only article with solid numbers I've found).<br>
-Restored Dance of Death events for now, will decide what to do with it later.<br>
-Fixes to VIET namespace.<br>
<b>v0.2:</b><br>
-Updated CK2+ base to v3.11.2.<br>
-Removed some more silly VIET events (urine)<br>
-Added the humours trait system from Friends & Foes mod (includes personality type traits and subtraits, as well as events related to them).<br>
<b>v0.1.1:</b><br>
-Decreased child mortality, still much larger than vanilla, but 60% of children will no longer die.<br>
-Removed some of the most ridiculous and pointless events from VIET (toothbrushing and cocks).<br>
-Decreased revolt risk, caused by angered peasants event.<br>
-Fixed display of modified religions.<br>
-Removed overlap of music files.<br>
<b>v0.1:</b><br>
Initial release.<br>

<b>HPR Feature List:</b><br>
-CK2+ base mechanics and flavors.<br>
-SWMH Map.<br>
-Centralization law system from EMF.<br>
-ARKO interface.<br>
-ARKO armories.<br>
-VIET events.<br>
-Friends & Foes personality traits.<br>
-Jus Uxoris spouse title usurpation mechanics.<br>
-Rebels and Warmongers branching education mechanics.<br>
-A unique map visual, pieced together from several different mods.<br>
-Better Looking Garbs mod portraits.<br>
-Dorimi music pack.<br>
-Songs from the four corners music pack.<br>
-Negative tax modifier on buildings from EMF and rebalanced tax of buildings, but no levy modifier. The logic behind this is that buildings require maintanence, hence the tax penalty. The levy modifier was not logical and destroyed the balance by giving rulers with many buildings too many levies, de facto creating a regular army way before it started to exist historically.<br>
-Lower bonuses for tech advancements, EMF-like.<br>
-Historical age of marriage: 12 for girls and 14 for boys.<br>
-Dramatically increased number of stillbirths and infant deaths for historical accuracy. Also decreased the average life span of characters by ~10 years, before the change many characters used to live long into their 60s and even 70s, which is ahistorical. Some characters will still survive till that age, but it will be a lot less common. This doesn't mean characters in their 40s will all suddenly start to die for no reason, it just means that the world has become a lot more deadly and staying in good health matters.<br>
-Fear mechanics that are unique to this mod and work in a way similar to the tyrrany system from CK2+, except striking fear in the hearts of men works in a positive way, making them respect you more. Oderint dum metuant.<br>
Fear is currently accumulated through acts of cruelty, such as torturing, blinding and castrating prisoners, as well as executing nobles after capturing them in a siege and as a result of some other events.<br>
-Trespasser capturing mechanics, that allow you (and the ai) to attemt to capture commanders that are leading troops through your territory, imprison them and possibly hold them for ransom, while not allied or at war with them. The success rate is based on your intrigue and will lower the target's opinion of you in case of failure. This is similar to the famous historical event, when Richard Lionheart was captured and imprisoned by Duke Leopold and later transferred into custody of the HRE Emperor Henry VI.<br>
-More detailed focuses with various penalties and bonuses.<br>
-Warscore with an emphasis on battles and sieges of capitals and contested territory.<br>
-Various other small tweaks and changes.<br>

<b>TODO:</b><br>
-General balance tweaks.<br>
-Tweaking more numbers for historical accuracy.<br>
-Testing and debugging.<br>
-Clean up unused scripts and assets.<br>

<b>Known issues:</b><br>
-Sometimes imprisoned characters have their opinion modifier triggered twice.<br>
