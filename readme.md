There are currently two popular mods that change the core mechanics of the game, while sticking to the historical backbone: Crusader Kings Plus and Historical Immersion Project (which itself consists of several mods).
This mod is based on both of them and the goal of this mod is to implement the better features of both major mods, while reaching maximum historical accuracy and maintaining an engaging and interesting gameplay. History Plus Realism is based on the CK2+ codebase with cherrypicked changes from HIP and other mods, as well as custom modifications for further realism. It might be considered a metamod, because of how it tries to integrate many other mods together by compliling everything you need in a single module.

HPR has been made by me for my personal use and is unlikely to be actively maintained in the future. It also goes against the rules of Paradoxplaza forums and is therefore not published there. The very notion of having to ask for permission to use mod files in other mods sickens me, this obviously means, that you are free to use any of the changes I've made to the game and it's modifications in your own projects. All credit for the original mods used in HPR goes to their authors.

The music mod is now available for download at<br> https://mega.nz/#!gxt1xSRB!7YgAoQUS-iCiN6C_Ghr3bzbVnXYhqa0QmcMiGy2szB4 <br>

<b>Changelog:</b><br>
<b>v0.4:</b><br>
-Major events overhaul. Bonuses of VIET events have been increased drastically (from 5 to 10 times in most cases). Now these events actually matter, not just display some text and because they matter, their frequency of appearance has been decreased (yearly pulse events are now bi yearly, bi yearly are five yearly and five yearly are decade pulse).
-Fixed over 500 event related bugs, according to the Validator.
-Dulcinian heresy added.
<b>v0.3.1:</b><br>
-Updated ARKO interface to 2015-08-20.<br>
-Added missing VIET lifestyle trait related events.<br>
-Started modifying VIET event results to make them matter.<br>
-Added music from "Songs from the four corners" mod (with account for additional CK2+ culture groups).<br>
-Due to the music folder getting too bloated, split off music into a separate mod. Misc. music fixes.<br>
-Some minor bugfixes.<br>
<b>v0.3:</b><br>
-Updated CK2+ base to v3.11.3.<br>
-Blinding can now be done to all prisoners, castration can now be done by all characters to all male prisoners.<br>
-Added fear mechanics, still very raw and requires testing.<br>
-Tweaked birth and child mortality a bit up again, it's really hard to get these numbers right, since there's so little information available on the topic
(http://www.sarahwoodbury.com/life-expectancy-in-the-middle-ages/ is the only article with solid numbers I've found).<br>
-Restored Dance of Death events for now, will decide what to do with it later.<br>
-Fixes to VIET namespace.<br>
<b>v0.2:</b><br>
-Updated CK2+ base to v3.11.2.<br>
-Removed some more silly VIET events (urine)<br>
-Added the humours trait system from Friends & Foes mod (includes personality type traits and subtraits, as well as events related to them).<br>
<b>v0.1.1:</b><br>
-Decreased child mortality, still much larger than vanilla, but 60% of children will no longer die.<br>
-Removed some of the most ridiculous and pointless events from VIET (toothbrushing and cocks).<br>
-Decreased revolt risk, caused by angered peasants event.<br>
-Fixed display of modified religions.<br>
-Removed overlap of music files.<br>
<b>v0.1:</b><br>
Initial release.<br>

<b>Current changes, compared to CK2+:</b><br>
-Centralization law system from EMF.<br>
-Negative tax modifier on buildings from EMF and rebalanced tax of buildings, but no levy modifier. The logic behind this is that buildings require maintanence, hence the tax penalty. The levy modifier was not logical and destroyed the balance by giving rulers with many buildings too many levies, de facto creating a regular army way before it started to exist historically.<br>
-Lower bonuses for tech advancements, EMF-like.<br>
-Historical age of marriage: 12 for girls and 14 for boys.<br>
-Dramatically increased number of stillbirths and infant deaths for historical accuracy. Also decreased the average life span of characters by ~10 years, before the change many characters used to live long into their 60s and even 70s, which is ahistorical. Some characters will still survive till that age, but it will be a lot less common. This doesn't mean characters in their 40s will all suddenly start to die for no reason, it just means that the world has become a lot more deadly and staying in good health matters.<br>
-Warscore with an emphasis on battles and sieges of capitals and contested territory.<br>
-ARKO interface.<br>
-Viet traits.<br>
-Viet events.<br>
-Friends & Foes personality traits.<br>
-Dorimi music pack.<br>
-Songs from the four corners music pack.<br>
-Fear mechanics that are unique to this mod and work in a way similar to the tyrrany system from CK2+, except striking fear in the hearts of men works in a positive way, making them respect you more. Oderint dum metuant.<br>
Fear is currently accumulated through acts of cruelty, such as torturing, blinding and castrating prisoners, as well as executing nobles after capturing them in a siege. In the future I plan to implement fear accumulation in a variety of events.<br>
-Various other small tweaks and changes.<br>

<b>TODO:</b><br>
-Rebalance traits and focuses.<br>
-General balance tweaks.<br>
-Tweaking more numbers for historical accuracy.<br>
-Testing and debugging.<br>
-Clean up unused scripts and assets.<br>

<b>Known issues:</b><br>
-Display of religions is not perfect due to the modified religion icon strip, but it's tolerable and no longer produces glitches with new CK2+ religions.
