EDC_I_STRONGA;Me no small eater! I strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NO_GREEDA;Sharing is caring I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_NO_CHARITY;"I am no charity case", [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] says...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_NO_CHARITYA;No harm done.... I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_I_QUICK;I see now, you cannot be a good ruler if you give everything away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_I_QUICKA;I am smarter than I thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_U_QUICK;One is left with nothing if everything has left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NO_PROUDA;A Karling no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_NO_PROUDB;Is [FromFrom.GetSheHe] really a Karling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_KARLING;You are a Karling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_ZEAL_HUM;Everything was given to you by [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_EVIL_PROUD;Maybe, I am just better than everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_ZEAL_WROTH;I will smash them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_ZEAL_ENVY;Why do they occupy our ancestral lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NOT_NICE;Torturing others brings me pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_HUMBLE_CRAVEN;There are things I cannot yet do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_BRAVE_SHY;Rather this than a fancy dinner party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EDC_CONTENT_SHY;That is the way I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I_LOVE_DINNER_PARTIES;Now how about some food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
I_WILL_WAIT;Now we play the waiting game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GREAT_BEING_KID;It is great being a kid, I get to muck around all day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_SAD_CHILDA;Give [From.GetTitledFirstName] a warm hug.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_SAD_CHILDB;I think [From.GetTitledFirstName] needs time alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_HAPPY_CHILD;Out of the blue, my [From.GetTitledFirstName] gave me a hug.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_HAPPY_CHILDA;I see now. I hurt others because they hurt me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NO_DECEIT;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] may not be always truthful but at least [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is no longer a compulsive liar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_NO_DECEITA;No more lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NO_GOD;It is all made up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
THINK_FOR_YOURSELF;You should draw your own conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_I_DUMB;I do not understand what my [From.GetTitledFirstName] is saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_I_DUMBA;I really don't get it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_U_DUMB;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] seems to be on the slow side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_ENVY_GUARD;Aren't you afraid that you are going to make enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_AMB_MARTIAL;Work harder, sky is not the limit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_GET2KNOW;Religion is not the enemy, it is the hatred in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EDC_NO_CRUEL;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] stopped torturing small animals. More importantly, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] seem to get a long better with other children and courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EDC_NO_CRUELA;Life is no longer cruel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HEY_NO_MORE;Hey! I said, no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x









BRC_NO;Sometimes I feel so alone, I cannot handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_NO_A;I am misguided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_NA;While I was relaxing, I heard children chattering about. Purely out of curiosity, I approach them - not to eavesdrop on their conversation.\nThey are talking about me! How I always act all high and mighty around other noble children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_NA_A;Oh, they will pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_NA_B;Well, the mighty [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_UR;I see now, I can get other people to do what I want by tricking them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_UR_A;Call me "Rogue".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_UR_B;Hey! Hey! Anyone want to plot with me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_CN;With my charm, I talked a noble out of rebelling against their liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_CN_A;But I can't talk that girl out of that swing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_GE;Diplomacy is my second nature - I can persuade the toughest nanny to do my bidding, convince a lion to mate with a cat and ....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_GE_A;...sway an Englishman into silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_GE_B;...encourage a Frenchman to never surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_IW;Today, I set a trap for a snobby noble child who was spreading rumours about my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_IW_A;Do not worry - the hole is only 4 metres deep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_ES;Nobody noticed when I casually walked out of my room last night. I am able to blend into the shadows even in broad day light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_ES_A;I am the darkness and I am the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_IWZ;I am going to buy this, buy this and buy this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_IWZ_A;Wow that is cheap, too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_TC;Okay, I remember what happened last time. I am only going to buy what I need. You know what? I am not even going to buy what I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRC_TC_A;I have all these money saved up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_FB;Okay, okay! It was a bad idea to not save up my money by not buying much needed pen and paper. You have to use money to make money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_FB_A;I will be a fortunellionaire in no time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_MT;I have built my fortune - 10 ducats and counting - at the tender age of 12. Now I look to the future where I will rule the world with my golden fist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_MT_A;Everything I touch will be in awe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_TJ;I understand now.\nI am not good at anything.\nI am not bad at everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_TJ_A;I guess I could be a language teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_DP;I get bored easily whenever I receive lectures about religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_DP_A;At least, it is more interesting than alchemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_DC;I can read and write better than most of - so called - nobles of the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_DC_A;Theology is so boring though!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_ST;I try to persuade a courtier to take interest in theology. He seemed very disinterested.\nHow can I blame him? Just few years ago, I acted the exact same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_ST_A;Theology is my calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_MTH;Theology is not about any deity. I believe theology is about understanding the development of human social infrastructure and how different religions live in that infrastructure like a living organism. Perhaps one could also view theology as a collection of theories of religion within the context of human history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_MTH_A;I pondered as I waited for my cake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_MW;I got beaten up by bunch of kids. They looked like they were lowborn children. I will become stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_MW_A;Strength is the key to power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_TS;I got into a fight. It was three on one. One kid attack me from the rear, I grabbed him and tossed him in the mud. Second kid came from the side, I kicked him and pushed him into the river. The third one tried to tackle me down, I gave him an one-two punch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_TS_A;Those two year olds did not stand a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_STC;I got into a fight again but this time I had company - my right-hand man, code name Lion and my left-hand henchman, code name Wolf. I ordered Lion to cut off the enemies and instructed Wolf to chase the runaways. My foes did not stand a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_STC_A;Not one shall leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


BRC_BS;I got tired of fighting toddlers, I need a real challenge. I gathered around thirty children from [Root.Location.GetName] to conquer a nearby province. We had two cities under our control but then it was dinner time so we went back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_BS_A;Yum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_NF;I defeated a soldier with a short blade. The training was finally paying off. I could glide through the air like a blade. I no longer need a shield to shield me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_NF_A;I am becoming a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BRC_IWR;Any weapon in my hand becomes an extension of me. I do not need an armour because my wit protects me. My place is on the battlefield - that is where I am immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRC_IWR_A;I am the warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
