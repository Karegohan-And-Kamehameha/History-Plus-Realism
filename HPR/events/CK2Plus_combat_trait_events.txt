# tiers required to level-up their combat trait.
#
# valid for all characters that can take the ambition (could be
# open to more), whether they've enabled the ambition or not. of
# course, enabling the ambition dramatically increases the odds
# of this event firing.
#
# the associated ambitions are strict about gender: females can
# only take them when conditions are such that they are allowed
# to participate in battle.  neither this on_combat_pulse series
# nor the victorious duel series enforce that directly (in the
# first case because it's implied by the event firing at all and
# in the second because XP advancement is just fine if a female
# somehow gets into a duel when she can't participate in battles,
# as it is for non-rulers and non-marshals as well).

# Victorious Duel (opponent slain or spared)

# FROMFROM will be the loser and ROOT=FROM will be the winner. This event is a model of DuelEngine.901 scope-wise, and indeed,
# it was originally called directly from NDE's duel outcomes rather than duel output events However, I wanted to minimize merge
# conflicts with NDE, so DuelEngine.901 forwards back to the [possibly dead] loser in CombatTraits.11, which immediately bounces
# back to the winner here, in CombatTraits.10, allowing full access to FROMFROM (and FROMFROM's portait) in child events. A little
# silly but not.
#
# Again, this is a hidden-window event which does bookkeeping and only fires visible messaging events when appropriate.
# It could not be (unlike the combat impulse event), but a single victorious duel does not earn an experience tier (only 3
# and always exactly 3 victories would be required if it did).  Instead, each duel win has a random chance of advancing
# the character's experience tier.  The cumulative density function for experience tier advancement needs to be tuned for
# balance.
#
# NOTE: progress notifications were skipped in this case, as there is enough event-chain clutter for the user to click
#       their way through during/after duels (and they're likely in the middle of a battle, which presents yet more).
